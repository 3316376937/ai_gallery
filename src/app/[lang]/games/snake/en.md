A fun creative Snake game that combines classic gameplay with interesting ideas. We also welcome everyone to suggest more gameplay features!

## Creative Snake Game Rules Introduction

In the game, you'll control a constantly moving snake. Use keyboard arrow keys or swipe on touchscreen to change the snake's direction. Your main goal is to **guide the snake to eat the food** (üçé) that appears in the field. Each time you eat food, the snake grows longer. However, be careful - the game ends if you hit a wall, your own body, or any obstacles in the field.

The game offers **rich customization options** that let you adjust the gaming experience according to your preferences. You can adjust the difficulty level at any time from the right side of the game interface, which will change the number of obstacles in real-time. You can also freely choose to enable or disable various special power-ups to make the game more challenging and fun. When you need a break, you can pause the game and continue your adventure later.

**Game Status Display**: To help you better track your progress, multiple important pieces of information are displayed at the top of the interface. You can clearly see the current game time, which allows you to **challenge your best record**. The interface also shows the amount of food you've collected and the remaining power-ups, helping you adjust your strategy in time.

The game features three carefully calibrated difficulty levels suitable for players of different skill levels: In Easy mode, only a few obstacles appear in the field, perfect for beginners to familiarize themselves with the game mechanics. Medium mode increases the number of obstacles, adding moderate challenge to the game. Hard mode places numerous obstacles in the field, which demands high requirements for your reaction speed and route planning abilities.

## Special Power-up System

To make the game more interesting and strategic, we designed three unique power-ups that randomly appear in the field during gameplay. Each power-up has its distinct effect, and using them wisely will help you achieve better scores in the game.

### Ghost Mode Power-up

When you see the vortex symbol (üåÄ), that's the ghost mode power-up. After obtaining this power-up, your snake will **gain one chance to pass through an obstacle**. This ability is particularly useful when you're trapped between obstacles, giving you a second chance to escape. When your snake hits any obstacle, ghost mode automatically activates, allowing you to safely pass through that obstacle, **after which the ability disappears**.

### Food Rain Power-up

Occasionally, you'll see a magical tree symbol (üå≥) in the game - that's the food rain power-up. Once collected, it will **randomly generate multiple pieces of food** in the field. These food items **exist simultaneously for a short time**, providing an excellent opportunity for rapid growth. Food rain lasts for about 5 seconds, during which you need to collect as much food as possible.

### Golden State Power-up

The most precious is the crown symbol (üëë), representing the **golden state power-up**. After obtaining this power-up, your snake immediately turns golden. In this state, you become invincible and can **directly break through any obstacles** in your path. Although the golden state lasts for a short time, during this period you can charge through recklessly, clearing away those annoying obstacles. This power-up not only helps you create new paths but also allows you to quickly escape from dangerous situations.

These special power-ups appear randomly and will disappear after a short time on the field. Therefore, you need to seize the opportunity to collect them when you see them. You can choose to enable or disable any power-ups in the game settings to adjust the gaming experience according to your preferences. Proper use of these power-ups will bring more strategy and possibilities to your game.
