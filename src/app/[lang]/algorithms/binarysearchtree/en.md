A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree data structure with the following characteristics:

- Each node contains a value (key);
- All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the current node's value;
- All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the current node's value;
- Both left and right subtrees are also binary search trees.

## Binary Search Tree Visualization

This page provides an interactive visualization tool for binary search trees, helping users deeply understand the structure and operational principles of BSTs.

### Tree Initialization

When starting to use the visualization tool, you can first initialize a binary search tree. The page offers flexible initialization options, allowing users to specify the tree size ranging from 1 to 50 nodes. This range setting can demonstrate both simple tree structures and more complex scenarios.

Two different value generation methods are supported for initialization. The first is random value mode, where the system generates unique random numbers between 1 and 1000 as node values. This mode simulates real-world random data scenarios, showing tree formations under different data distributions. The second is sequential value mode, where the system generates values in sequence (0,1,2...). **This mode is particularly helpful in understanding potential tree degradation when handling ordered data**.

### Basic Operations

The visualization tool implements three core operations for binary search trees, each showing real-time changes in the tree structure. The Insert operation allows users to add new nodes, **with the system automatically finding suitable positions while maintaining BST properties**. Users can clearly observe how new nodes find their correct positions.

The Delete operation demonstrates the complex process of removing nodes from the tree. **When deleting a node, the system automatically handles the reorganization of its child nodes, ensuring the tree's structural integrity and correctness**. Particularly when deleting nodes with two children, users can observe the selection and replacement process of successor nodes.

The Search operation showcases the efficient lookup advantage of binary search trees. Users can input any value to search, and the system displays the complete search path, visually demonstrating the binary search process.

## Time Complexity Analysis

The performance of a binary search tree is closely related to its structure. Under ideal conditions, when the tree maintains good balance, BSTs can provide highly efficient operational performance.

In average cases, basic operations in BSTs achieve logarithmic time complexity. Search operations have O(log n) time complexity because each comparison halves the search range, forming a typical binary search process. Insert operations also have O(log n) time complexity, as they require first searching to determine the insertion position, followed by constant-time node linking operations. **Although delete operations may involve successor node search and tree reorganization**, their time complexity remains at O(log n).

However, in the worst case, when the binary search tree degrades into a linked list, its performance significantly deteriorates. This typically occurs when inserting nodes in ordered sequence, such as inserting 1,2,3,4,5 in sequence. In this case, each new node is inserted at the bottom level of the right subtree, causing the tree to completely lose balance and become a single linked list. In such degraded cases, all basic operations degrade to O(n) time complexity, as each operation requires traversing the entire list to complete.

Moreover, in scenarios requiring frequent modifications, numerous insert and delete operations may cause the tree structure to gradually become unbalanced. While this can be resolved through periodic tree rebuilding, such solutions incur additional performance overhead. **This characteristic makes standard BSTs less suitable for data storage scenarios requiring frequent updates**.

## Alternative Data Structures

When binary search trees cannot meet performance requirements, we can consider some more advanced data structures. These structures are improvements and optimizations based on BSTs, each with its specific application scenarios.

AVL Trees: **AVL trees are the first self-balancing binary search trees invented, maintaining balance by strictly controlling the height difference between left and right subtrees**. In AVL trees, the height difference between any node's left and right subtrees cannot exceed 1, ensuring the tree height always remains at O(log n) level. After each insert or delete operation, AVL trees restore balance through rotation operations.

Red-Black Trees: **These are weakly balanced binary search trees that maintain balance by coloring nodes (red or black) and maintaining specific color rules**. Compared to AVL trees, red-black trees have more relaxed balance conditions, only ensuring that the longest path from root to leaf is no more than twice the shortest path. This design provides good performance while greatly reducing the operations needed for maintaining balance.

Due to this good balance between equilibrium and performance, red-black trees are widely used in practical engineering. For example, Java's TreeMap and TreeSet, C++'s map and set, and Linux kernel's completely fair scheduler all use red-black trees as their underlying data structure.

B-Trees and B+ Trees: Multi-way search trees specially designed for disk and external storage devices. Unlike binary trees, these trees' nodes can contain multiple keys and children. **B-trees store data in all nodes, while B+ trees only store data in leaf nodes, using non-leaf nodes solely for indexing**. This structural design significantly reduces disk I/O operations.

[Skip Lists](https://gallery.selfboot.cn/en/algorithms/skiplist): Skip lists are linked list-based data structures that accelerate search operations by adding multiple layers of indexes to each node. Skip lists achieve O(log n) time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations, making them viable alternatives to balanced binary search trees in certain scenarios.
